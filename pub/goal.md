#Goal.

This file is like the 'outline' file for the whole project. Do not erase anything that has been written here just edit it so that after completing the project I can see how I tackled every problem and how I got to the finish.

This technology should be widely used and I should have full control over it. After first release, remove from github.

I should have full control over this project and I should be able to track the activity of the technology where ever it is being used. Like I should be able to view and track its performance.

I am thinking in the lines of simplifying a language. Like babel

OR

Simplifying React? as it is very very very complicated.
